In Lab 7, I compared the words &#8220;Love&#8221; and &#8220;Hate&#8221; using the N-Gram tool for popular word frequency visualization that Google N-gram features through its software/application.

The two functions showed some compelling data to consider. The amount of times &#8220;Love&#8221; dictates a profound movement in statistical data on both of the graphs is visually of great importance in terms of how we view specific time periods. This shows in contrast to the word hate, how often Love dominates as a theme in the literature used to search through this large source of data. This exercise conveys precisely what we can&#8217;t visualize through our our words, and how visuals such as graphs are a great conduit for sources of information that can be complex to visualize without the aid of tools such as this.<a href="http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/04/FullSizeRender-4.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1505"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1505" src="http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/04/FullSizeRender-4-300x225.jpg" alt="FullSizeRender-4" width="220" height="29" /></a>

For the next method of the lab, i explored Lexos and generated a &#8220;Multicloud&#8221; visualization for the State of the union corpus we have used in class over the semester. This is a very beneficial way to explore the various unorthodox ways to visualize data that persists in literature. For example: Using the corpus from the state of the union addresses we have archived, i was able to create a word map that helps convey further the dominating appearances of words such as: government, country, people, subject, justice, presidents, etc. This method of visualization can strike readers further than simply reading information off of a page of paper ever could because of its use of visualization lacks near as many limitations.

For step 4, i found the network graphing page to be an interesting question to ponder. Is it intuitive? Sort of. It does a good job of demonstrating the connections that can be made in literary texts that we may have not considered before, and does so by demonstrating linking graphs. I think that this approach, Network Visualization, is a very effective form of visualization. It has some of the most potential out of all the software we have used. I have never seen any other way to make all of the connections that are displayed in these types of visuals. I think that these forms of visualization are very transcendent in literary studies because now we have access to a way of visualizing complex information that could strengthen the argument a writer could have. As far as answering if this intuitive? I am curious to know more about what this means. Perhaps information predictability?

While creating my own fusion via Google, i ran into some errors in steps while using our downloaded data from our class box in Lab 7. I will re-adjust this step properly, after proper assistance.
