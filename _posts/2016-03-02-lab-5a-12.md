For this lab, I used the movie books mini-corpus I made for Lab 3. I put that in the Topic Modeling Tool application, and ran it a first time for 10 topics with 8 topic words per topic. Looking at the html version, this is what I got for my first list of topics:

&nbsp;

<a href="http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF1.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1154"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1154" src="http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF1-300x287.png" alt="RNF1" width="300" height="287" srcset="http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF1-300x287.png 300w, http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF1.png 525w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>

A lot of the words are obviously story specific, like “heathcliff,” “linton,” and “hareton” obviously belong to _Wuthering Heights_ while “peter” and “wendy” go with _Peter Pan_. Here’s an image of the “heathcliff” topic, so you can see what I mean.

&nbsp;

<a href="http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF2.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1155"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1155" src="http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF2-300x288.png" alt="RNF2" width="300" height="288" srcset="http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF2-300x288.png 300w, http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF2.png 516w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>

Obviously the _Wuthering Heights_ book dominates this topic, with 18,295 instances of these words; far above the 580 instances that come in _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_.

&nbsp;

Topic #9, however, didn’t immediately appear to me to belong specifically to any of the books in my corpus, so I looked further into that one.

<a href="http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF3.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1156"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1156" src="http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF3-300x288.png" alt="RNF3" width="300" height="288" srcset="http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF3-300x288.png 300w, http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF3.png 484w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>

This topic actually does occur a lot throughout the corpus, and _Wuthering Heights_, _Son of Tarzan_, _Frankenstein_, and _Tarzan_ all have many instances of this topic in their texts.

I wanted to look further into the proportions of these topics in _Wuthering Heights_, so I clicked on it and this screen came up.

<a href="http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF4.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1157"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1157" src="http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF4-300x278.png" alt="RNF4" width="300" height="278" srcset="http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF4-300x278.png 300w, http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF4.png 564w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>

Okay, so obviously the most important topic in this book is going to be the one with “Heathcliff” and “Catherine” in it. I found it interesting, though, that the other topic I looked at #9 with “eyes,” “father,” “thought,” “day,” etc. was found in 20% of the document.

I wondered if this same topic occurred a lot in any of the other texts as well, so I looked at the percentages of the topics in _Frankenstein_ as well.

<a href="http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF5.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1158"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1158" src="http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF5-300x261.png" alt="RNF5" width="300" height="261" srcset="http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF5-300x261.png 300w, http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF5.png 603w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>

_Frankenstein_’s most prominent topic was the “place, “made,” “poor,” “day” topic, but the second most prominent was this same topic #9. The difference between the first most prominent and second most also wasn’t nearly as drastic, with only 4% between them.

I though this made a lot of sense. Both _Frankenstein_ and _Wuthering Heights_ have characters who are concerned with their fathers, the passing of time, and thought, so for me, this topic #9 seemed like it would fit well in both of them.

I was curious about what would happen if I changed the number of topics, so I altered it to 16 topics, and ran it again, getting these results this time:

<a href="http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF6.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1159"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1159" src="http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF6-280x300.png" alt="RNF6" width="280" height="300" srcset="http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF6-280x300.png 280w, http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF6.png 535w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a>

This time, by doubling the number of topics, I thought I would be able to find some that were less book-specific, but that turned out not to be the case. The words in topic #10 didn’t seem very specific, consisting of “father,” “heard,” “cried,” etc., so I looked at that one.

<a href="http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF7.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1160"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1160" src="http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF7-294x300.png" alt="RNF7" width="294" height="300" srcset="http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF7-294x300.png 294w, http://lindsaythomas.net/engl4590/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/03/RNF7.png 521w" sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px" /></a>

It surprisingly had a huge percentage in Wuthering Heights. Though it only ended up talking up 17% of the book.

This is one of those tools I think you really need to mess around and experiment with. The results are very interesting, though often much different than what you might expect.
