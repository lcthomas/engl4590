_Hey guys_. I don&#8217;t at all know what I am doing.

But it&#8217;s fine. **FINE. **Okay.

So my name is Kate. Not Kat or Katie or anything else. Just Kate. I don&#8217;t really know what to write but I saw other people talking about themselves so I&#8217;ll do that. I mean, who doesn&#8217;t like talking about themselves, am I right?

So some things about myself:

  * I&#8217;m a creative writing minor.
  * I work at Starbucks in Ingles.
  * I LOVE headbands. SO MUCH.
  * I just bought [these shoes](http://www.vans.com/shop/cosmic-galaxy-authentic-lo-pro)
  * I have the song &#8220;Closing Time&#8221; in my head right now.
  * My best friend and I have been friends for NINE years.

here is a photo of us hugging the poetry section of a bookstore. naturally.

_I CANNOT FIND HOW TO DO A TABLE AND I EVEN GOOGLED IT! OH NO! HELP!_

I hate to say this but I really hate the text view as opposed to the WYSIWYG view. I found it super hard to work in the text mode. The only upside is that you can kind of see what you are doing but it doesn&#8217;t really show it. The good thing about the WYSIWYG mode is that it is interactive. When I bold something, I see it as bold instead of seeing &#8220;But it&#8217;s fine.<strong> FINE. </strong>Okay.&#8221; I see &#8220;But it&#8217;s fine. **FINE. **Okay.&#8221; When I click on the text mode, it makes me nervous. If you enter one small thing wrong, it won&#8217;t work even though I guess its the same for anything but the WYSIWYG mode is just more user friendly. I guess another pro of the text mode, is to actually see the HTML coding and to see how things work behind the scenes. However, I think that the WYSIWYG mode should be the more prevalent one.

Alan Liu writes that, &#8220;the chances are that one is already producing content that somewhere along the route of its transmission takes the form of a uniquely contemporary kind of discourse: encoded or structured discourse,&#8221; which is exactly what we are doing here and have been doing, I have just never realized. I have worked in WordPress before doing blog posts for the university and for a class last year so I am kind of familiar with it but I still feel apprehensive about my knowledge on HTML and I definitely never used the text mode. But I have been encoding discourse for classes and not even really realized it.
