  If you&#8217;ve ever had a roommate, you know how much <strong>fun</strong> living with another person can be. If you think about it, having six roommates could make your life six times as <strong>fun</strong>! You now have six extra closets to choose outfits from everyday, six people to steal food from, six people to watch Netflix shows with from start to finish, six people to dance to Justin Bieber music videos with, six people to borrow cars from when yours breaks down, and six people to take care of you when you&#8217;re sick.

  If you&#8217;ve ever had a roommate, you probably also know how easy it is to become annoyed with each other. So imagine having six roommates. Seven different personalities colliding at all times, and what makes things even more annoying sometimes is that we&#8217;re all girls. Seven girls in one house. Some girls are neat freaks, while others are complete slobs. Some girls exercise during all hours of the day and make kale smoothies for breakfast, while others sit on the couch and watch twelve episodes of <em>One Tree Hill</em> as they down a carton of Chocolate Trinity ice cream. Some girls can&#8217;t go to sleep with dirty dishes in the sink, while others can&#8217;t go to sleep if their bedroom floor is visible. Some girls are engaged to be married, while others have never dated anyone.

  If you decide that you&#8217;d like to make your life six times as <strong>fun</strong> as it currently is by living with six other girls, here are a few tips to make sure you maximize the <strong>fun</strong> and minimize the annoyances:<ins datetime="2016-01-25T18:16:39+00:00"></ins>

      <li>
        Make homemade cashew milk by blending it up at 6 AM and waking up all of your roommates.<br /> <ins datetime="2016-01-25T18:16:39+00:00"></ins>
      </li>
      <li>
        Throw away your roommate&#8217;s oatmeal that she was apparently &#8220;saving&#8221; and don&#8217;t offer to replace it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Break your roommate&#8217;s vacuum cleaner by vacuuming up all of the hair that seven girls who share one house shed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Never wash the dishes or take the trash out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make your roommates feel bad about not knowing what they&#8217;re doing after they graduate in May by daily rubbing in the fact that you have interviews with three dental schools so far.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don&#8217;t ask, but borrow a pair of your roommate&#8217;s 6+ pairs of tennis shoes for two months, and then when she catches you wearing them and comments on them, claim y&#8217;all must&#8217;ve bought the same pair in 2012 or whenever Nike came out with Free 2.0.

Yes, I know that there are only six people in both of these pictures; we can ever seem to get all of our roommates together for a photo.

**Text Encoding Reflection**

Well, I am very technologically challenged, so this lab has been quite an interesting experience as I&#8217;ve tried to navigate through telling myself &#8220;you can do it&#8221; while I tried to complete all of the tasks set before me. There are many differences between the plain text editor and the WYSIWYG editor. For starters, the WYSIWYG editor is much simpler to use, especially for people who label themselves as &#8220;technologically challenged,&#8221; like me. With the plain text editor, the user is able to see the coding that goes into the post that he/she is creating, which can be cool if the user understands enough of the coding to know what is going on. However, the plain text editor can also cause the user to get bogged down in the technicalities of the encoding if he/she does not understand the coding enough to create his/her post successfully.
