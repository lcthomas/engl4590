# Why Christmas is Awesome!

 <cite>By Raelyn Fate</cite>

##  **Reason #1:** Christmas is not limited to just one day.

The anticipation and excitement of Christmas starts months in advance.

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>
      October
    </td>
    
    <td>
      November
    </td>
    
    <td>
      December
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      2 Days
    </td>
    
    <td>
      29 Days
    </td>
    
    <td>
      25 Days
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

  * Anticipation starts the day before Halloween in October
  * It grows the entire month of November (except Thanksgiving)
  * Leading up to the event, December is a breeding ground of Holiday Cheer

### **Reason #2:**The Decorations!

##### **Reflection:**

After struggling through the process of making this blog post, the whole concept of HTML coding seems unnecessarily difficult to me. Trying to make sure that every single letter and symbol I typed was correct was kind of infuriating, especially because I am so used to just pushing a button when I do things like bold or italicize a text. It took me forever to finally get the picture to show up and I wanted so badly to just copy and paste it into the document so I could actually see the picture there. Editing in the plain text editor instead of the WYSIWYG method was much more difficult than I thought it would be, and I found myself saying a little prayer each time I went to preview the document in the hope that my little snowman picture would finally show up this time.

The act of coding in this text only editor actually reminds me a lot of studying a foreign language. When you first begin, it is exceedingly difficult and you try to translate things directly in your head or on paper to figure out what exactly is going on. After studying a new language for a while, however, your mind begins to comprehend text and spoken word in the foreign language without having to directly translate it. I think that HTML coding is really similar to this. Right now, because I don’t really know what I’m doing, I find it extremely difficult to try to picture what the physical presentation is going to look like after all of the text is translated by the computer systems. I’m sure that people who are much more advanced in the subject are able to directly predict what is going to happen when they are typing out the code, and probably don’t need to switch back and forth from the text editor to the WYSIWYG one. This relates well with Liu’s discussion on page 58 of the separation of text content from the presentation. Unless you are extremely knowledgeable in the processes of HTML coding, you probably aren’t going to be able to have a physical representation of the finished product in your mind as you code. For me, the content that I want to provide to my user is completely separate from the HTML coding methods that I have to use to make it that way; and if I do my coding correctly, the user will never actually be aware of all of the effort. After reading Liu, I’m still a little confused on what he thinks of the separation of these two entities. For me, I don’t really see the value in having the two so very separate from one another, but I think I would like to read more on Liu’s consideration of the matter.
