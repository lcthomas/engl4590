This is one of my favorite quotes. It is by Lawrence M. Krauss who is an astrophysicist. It is from a book he wrote called _A Universe from Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather Than Nothing_. He said:

“Every atom in your body came from a star that exploded. And, the atoms in your left hand probably came from a different star than your right hand. It really is the most poetic thing I know about physics: You are all stardust. You couldn’t be here if stars hadn’t exploded, because the elements &#8211; the carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, all the things that matter for evolution and for life &#8211; weren’t created at the beginning of time. They were created in the nuclear furnaces of stars, and the only way for them to get into your body is if those stars were kind enough to explode. So, forget Jesus. The stars died so that you could be here today.”

<u>Reflection</u>
  
Writing in text instead of visual seems to me to be superfluous and more difficult than is necessary. I understand why coding is important but on a platform such as WordPress it just seems to be unnecessary. However, in connection with Liu&#8217;s article, it is interesting because it shows two types of data that can be used on the same format. There is the “what you see is what you get” view (what most people use when they use when they use WordPress) and I know that I am not consciously thinking about the html coding when writing a wordpress post. It is interesting because there is actually more data than there appears to be in the visual view. It shows the different forms of data and how they interact with each other, and is also an example of how different digital text is from traditional text. Digital text and formatting such as we have done in this lab are very different than simply writing something down with pen on paper or something like that. This form of text is very different and this lab made me realize that—although I will still be using the visual tab when make wordpress posts of my own. ☺
