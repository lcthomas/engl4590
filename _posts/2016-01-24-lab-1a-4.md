# NASA Earthrise Image

This image was taken on NASA&#8217;s **Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter** as Earth is in orbit around the moon. In this image, Earth appears to be rising from the lunar horizon from the viewpoint of the spacecraft it was taken on.

The Sahara Desert can be seen in the upper right corner of the image. It is the large, tan area. South America can be seen to the left of the image.

You can learn more about this image from NASA [here](//www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/lro-earthrise-2015).

_NASA&#8217;s first Earthrise image was taken in 1966._

This is what NASA does:

Writing a post using the plain text editor is much different than writing a post using the WYSIWYG editor. To begin with, the W editor is much more complicated and requires more time and background knowledge. When first approaching the W editor, one must know how to code using HTML. When doing this coding, it is hard to tell exactly what something will look like when it is published on a webpage. Until you are able to preview or publish the coding, there is no way to tell if it looks the way it should or not. For example, if you make a mistake in the coding, you may not be able to tell where it is until after you look at the published screen as a whole. When using plain text coding, there are a lot fewer steps involved. Because writing with plain text is so clear and simple, there is much less room for errors to be made. For example, instead of having to previously know how to create the way the text forms or looks on the webpage, someone can easily click a button to create those same effects.

There are several advantages and disadvantages writing with the W editor. When coding with this system, someone has the ability to design and create a webpage as he/she pleases. The designer can be as detailed and complex as he/she desires. One the other hand, though, the W editor is much more complicated. It requires a lot of background knowledge with html coding before the writing of the post can even take place.

Just like coding with the W editor, there are very clear advantages and disadvantages to coding with the plain text editor. The plain text editor is very simple. There are many buttons and features to choose from that can make the webpage look as the designer pleases. The real disadvantage would be the lack of being able to create an intricate design that the W editor can create in a webpage.

Liu makes a reference to “the separation of content from material instantiation or formal presentation” in his article, Transcendental Data: Toward a Cultural History and Aesthetics of the New Encoded Discourse. HTML encoding enacts what Liu is describing in this article. As one codes with the various steps involved in HTML, he/she has to mentally unpack what is happening on the screen and in the program. By that, I mean that the content of what is going to show on the webpage is separate from the complicated aspects of the coding itself. The coder has to think about the webpage in two aspects: the coding (what won’t be seen) and the content within the coding (what will be seen). The two come together to create what Liu describes as a “formal presentation.”
