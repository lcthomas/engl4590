The Yorkshire Terrier breed originated in Yorkshire, England in the 19th century. This breed was designed to be small for the purpose of catching rats. The breed’s nickname is Yorkie. Their physical appearance and stature is fairly small which leaves them in the “Toy” group according to the American Kennel Club. Yorkies usually do not exceed 7 pounds, but there has been Yorkies that have been reported to be as heavy as 15 pounds. They also have a blackish-brown/gray coat. However, it could potentially take up to 3 years for the dog’s final color to come in.
  
The breed’s life expectancy is 13-16 years. Yorkies are known to be “lap dogs.” They are fun-loving dogs, but temperaments vary among the breed. Most Yorkie owners lists their Yorkie as:

  * Active
  * Overprotective
  * Curious
  * Attention-seeking
  * Yappie

Due to these descriptions, Yorkies are not suitable for young children. They are jealous dogs and require an ample amount of attention from the adult owners. They are also small dogs which means they are prone to broken bones if handled by younger children.

Yorkies are also an easy breed to train. They are very intelligent dogs and learn quickly. Since they are an active breed, it is important to remember to keep them active by playing with them and taking them for walks. Yorkies need active stimulation to enjoy a full life. In addition, below is a table containing pros and cons of the Yorkshire Terrier breed.

In my opinion, HTML encoding enacts what Liu refers to as “the separation of content from material instantiation or formal presentation” because it does just that (58). HTML separates itself from plain text by taking a completely different form. The formal presentation is the plain text we read on a computer screen. However, behind the scenes, there is a whole new world that most people do not even realize is occurring. This HTML practice helped open my eyes to a world of encoding that I knew existed but never really took it into consideration, while I read on my laptop. The “separation of content” is the HTML encoding itself. It is so structured and complex. It takes on a much more interesting form than the plain text we are used to seeing. It has a sort of hidden beauty of its own because most people do not realize the complexity of it.

In addition, typing my work into the plain text editor was completing different from using the WYSIWYG editor. The plain text editor was the HTML encoding side of the blog post, while the WYSIWYG was the normal text side of the post. I attempted to use just the plain text side as much as possible, but I would click back and forth to the WYSIWYG editor side to make sure it was correlating right. It was funny to think that I have been using wordpress for over a year now, and I did not even realize there was a “plain text side.” I was always working on the WYSIWYG side. Therefore, that was very eye-opening for me. The advantages of using the plain text side is that you get to learn how to use HTML encoding, so it is beneficial. However, the benefit of using the WYSIWYG editor is that you get to check your work and make sure everything is formatted right. That means that it is much simpler to use than the plain text side. However, another advantage of the plain text side is that it gives you some basic HTML codes to start off with. For example, it gives you the codes for bolding and italicizing words. That was very helpful to start off with. But the disadvantage, is that it is just a lot harder to work with because if you solely use the plain text side you will have no idea how your post is going to turn out. Therefore, I definitely prefer the WYSIWYG editor side.
