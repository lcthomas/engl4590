I used the 1901-1950 State of the Union corpus for this lab. First, some requested stats:

  * The bigram &#8220;the future&#8221; has a frequency of 279, but a stat value of 3.77. This is barely statistically significant, despite the high frequency in which it appears.
  * Some statistically significant collocates were &#8220;future generations&#8221;, as we discussed in class, &#8220;near future&#8221;, and &#8220;immediate future&#8221;. This might show that the 1901-1950 speeches were more concerned with the near future than the far future.
  * The most frequent bigrams where future is on the left are &#8220;future of&#8221; with a frequency of 20, **&#8220;future generations&#8221;** with a frequency of 7, and &#8220;future years&#8221;, also with a frequency of 7. On the right, they are &#8220;the future&#8221; with a frequency of 123, **&#8220;near future&#8221;** with a frequency of 12, and &#8220;of future&#8221;, also with a frequency of 12.
  * In the n-grams search, &#8220;future generations&#8221; has a frequency of 7, just like in the words search. &#8220;Near future&#8221; is the same with a frequency of 12.
  * The term &#8220;near future&#8221; appears in 1906-Roosevelt.txt, 1910-Taft.txt, and 1947-Truman.txt. 1947-Truman.txt has 2 hits, one referring to an investigation of labor disputes and the other saying he will communicate with Congress to create a single Department of National Defense. Most of the hits that I found refer to something the president plans to do in the &#8220;near future&#8221;.
  * When comparing with the Brown frequency list, some expected words that pop up more often than normal are &#8220;government&#8221;, &#8220;congress&#8221;, and &#8220;war&#8221;. One word that&#8217;s a little surprising is the keyness of &#8220;I&#8221;. It has a keyness of 345.

As you can see, I used keywords in a similar way to what Michaela Mahlberg did in her study of corpus linguistics/stylistics. She says, &#8220;Key words can provide a first overview of a text, pointing to words that are potentially useful for more detailed analysis&#8221; (&#8220;Corpus&#8221; 296). We generated a list of words in Antconc to do just that. As she looks at the context of &#8220;civility&#8221; in Austen&#8217;s works, so too do I look at the context of &#8220;future&#8221; in the State of the Union addresses.

What I learned from this analysis of the term &#8220;future&#8221; is that it can be concerned with either the far future (&#8220;future generations&#8221;) or the &#8220;near future&#8221;. When &#8220;near future&#8221; is invoked, the president is usually referring to something ongoing in the government or something he plans to do soon.

Unsurprisingly, there are far more references to government and law-related terms in the State of the Union addresses than in regular English. War is also a lot more frequent than peace in these texts, which also makes sense as this time period encompasses two World Wars. I&#8217;d like to explore the usage of war and peace more in the future perhaps (heh, future).

Malhberg also writes, &#8220;&#8230;the value of applying corpus methods is defined through the links that can be made between quantitative findings and qualitative analysis&#8221; (295), which is true. For example, I can tell you that &#8220;I&#8221; has a keyness of 345, but it&#8217;s effectively meaningless right now unless I make it clear what keyness represents. According to Heather Froehlich, &#8220;Keyness is a statistical measure of â€œthe frequency of a word in the text when compared with its frequency in a reference corpus.&#8221; So that keyness of 345 says that &#8220;I&#8221; is more frequent in the State of the Union addresses than the Brown frequency list. But if I really wanted to say what &#8220;I&#8221; was doing in the speeches, I&#8217;d have to look at specific instances of the term.
