**Wednesday, February 24: Topic Modeling 2**

  * **Lab 4 due by class**
  * Matthew Jockers, Ch. 8 &#8220;Theme,&#8221; _Macroanalysis_ (2013), read pgs 124-153
  * Matthew Jockers, <a href="http://www.matthewjockers.net/macroanalysisbook/macro-themes/" target="_blank">&#8220;500 Themes from a corpus of 19th-Century Fiction&#8221;</a> (interactive site for exploring Jockers&#8217; topic modeling; explore)
  * Download and open the <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/topic-modeling-tool/" target="_blank">Topic Modeling Tool</a> (we will use this for Lab 5a next Monday) 
      * Download the file from the link provided in step 1 on this page: <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/topic-modeling-tool/" target="_blank">https://code.google.com/archive/p/topic-modeling-tool/</a>. Save this file somewhere easily accessible on your computer (like the Desktop &#8212; you will need to find it again).
      * Try to _run _the file by double-clicking it. This should bring the program interface up. If this doesn&#8217;t work (if nothing happens, or if your computer _opens_ or _decompresses__ _the .jar file so that you see a bunch of folders and files, but doesn&#8217;t _run_ the program), you probably need to install Java on your computer. We&#8217;re going to install the Java Development Kit, which will save you time for Lab 6b. Here&#8217;s how to do that:
      * If you have a Mac: 
          * Open up System Preferences. If you have Java 7 or above installed on your computer, you should see the Java icon in the very bottom row. If you don&#8217;t see it, go to Applications > Utilities in Finder. If you see a &#8220;Java Preferences&#8221; option there, you have Java 6 installed on your computer. Either should work for this tool. Try double-clicking on the Topic Modeling Tool again. Email me if this isn&#8217;t working, but if you seem to have Java installed on your computer.
          * If you don&#8217;t see either of those things, you don&#8217;t have Java installed on your computer. Here&#8217;s how to install the Java Development Kit (JDK): 
              * Download the Mac OS X x64 version of the JDK from this page: <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html" target="_blank">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html</a>. Save it to your Desktop or somewhere else accessible, where you know where to find it.
              * Double-click the downloaded JDK .dmg file to launch the installer. Follow along with the instructions the installer gives you to install. You can also check these instructions (under &#8220;JDK Installation Instructions&#8221;) to install: <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/mac_jdk.html#CHDBADCG" target="_blank">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/mac_jdk.html#CHDBADCG</a>.
          * After installing Java, try double-clicking on the Topic Modeling Tool .jar files again to run it. If your computer tells you that it can&#8217;t open the file because it&#8217;s not from a trusted developer, go find the file on your Desktop (or wherever you have saved it) and press Control while clicking on the file (the equivalent in Macs to right-clicking). Select &#8220;Open with&#8221; and then &#8220;Jar launcher&#8221; (or whatever program is the default option &#8212; do NOT open it with an extractor or unzipper, though). This should open the program interface.
          * Email me if this doesn&#8217;t work.
      * If you have a Windows machine: 
          * If the Topic Modeling Tool .jar file doesn&#8217;t _run_ but instead your computer tries to _decompress_ and then _open_ a list of files, this likely means you don&#8217;t have Java installed on your computer. Here&#8217;s how to install the Java Development Kit (JDK): 
              * Download the Windows x86 version of the JDK from this page: <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html" target="_blank">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html</a>. If the x86 version doesn&#8217;t work for you, try the x64 version. Save it to your Desktop or somewhere else accessible, where you know where to find it.
              * Double-click the downloaded version of the JDK .exe file to launch the installer. Follow along with the instructions the installer gives you to install. You can also check these instructions if you run into trouble: <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/windows_jdk_install.html#CHDEBCCJ" target="_blank">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/windows_jdk_install.html#CHDEBCCJ</a>
          * If you run into PATH dependency errors: 
              * Try installing the Windows x86 Online version of the Java Runtime Environment instead, from this page: <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html" target="_blank">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html</a>.
              * Double-click the downloaded file to install. This should be a simpler install process.
          * If the Topic Modeling Tool tries to open using Adobe, try downloading and installing this tool: <a href="http://download.cnet.com/JAR_Runner/3000-2094_4-76475806.html" target="_blank">http://download.cnet.com/JAR_Runner/3000-2094_4-76475806.html </a>
          * Try double-clicking on the Topic Modeling Tool .jar file again to run the program. The program interface should open up.
          * Email me if this doesn&#8217;t work.

**Monday, February 29: Topic Modeling 3**

  * Explore Matthew Wilkens&#8217;s 100-topic model of 1,543 novels published in the United States between 1774 and 1875: <a href="http://wilkens.github.io/wright-topics/" target="_blank">http://wilkens.github.io/wright-topics/</a> 
      * Read the &#8220;About&#8221; page.
      * Using the &#8220;Overview&#8221; view (Grid or List), choose one topic to investigate further. Write down the top 5 novels associated with that topic, and when (what year/years) that topic was most prominent in the corpus historically.
      * Using the &#8220;Bibliography&#8221; view, choose one novel to investigate in more detail (or choose one of the novels included in the topic you investigated in the previous step). Ideally, this should be a novel that you&#8217;ve read. Click on the novel title to see its top topics. Write down its top 3-5 topics.
      * Building off of these initial investigations (or others), explore the model more and start to &#8220;close read&#8221; its topics (like we discussed in class on Wed, Feb 24). Write down anything else you find that is interesting or surprising. For example, does one topic dominate your chosen novel over the others? Does one topic dominate a particular historical period in the corpus over others? Why might this be so? Does one topic seem especially &#8220;incoherent&#8221; or hard to interpret? Why? What might this topic mean? Take some time to write down your thoughts.
      * Bring the document where you&#8217;ve written about the model to class, and come to class ready to talk about what you&#8217;ve investigated.
